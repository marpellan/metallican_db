Typically, this could include wood pallets, cardboard, plastic or metal drums, piping, work clothing, etc. 
Q15: In 1992, it was determined that both dams would be subject to gully erosion over time, resulting in a loss of stability. Erosion protection of the slope with rock riprap was therefore recommended and implemented. As part of the slope erosion protection design process, it was noted that the upper slope of the North Dam was subject to shallow slope instability in the spring during snow melt. Accordingly, in 1998, the dam was re-graded and protected with a rock riprap layer. Although the South Dam had not experienced the same type of shallow surface failures as the North Dam, in 1999, the overall slope of the South Dam was flattened and a rock riprap layer was placed over the entire slope. Both dams have performed well since remediation was completed, with no indication of the surficial erosion or shallow failures that had occurred prior to remediation.
