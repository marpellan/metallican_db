The original plan by Vancouver based mining company, Taseko Mines Ltd., called Prosperity Mine entailed an open-pit mine that would have completely destroyed Fish Lake (Teztan Biny), a fish bearing lake in the Chilcotin. This lake has an estimated 85,000 rainbow trout of which around 4,500-5,000 are caught annually. The Tsilhqot tribe have also expressed the importance of the island in Fish Lake as a place of spiritual power and healing, where present-day and past generations of Tsilhqotin conduct ceremonies to receive their spiritual powers.</p><p> Traditionally, mining companies built their own tailings ponds but an amendment to Canada's Fisheries Act in 2002 allowed natural lakes and creeks to be reclassified as 'tailings impoundment areas.' Since then the federal government has reclassified up to twenty additional lakes as dumps. The intent of Taseko was to drain Fish Lake and destroy Little Fish Lake for use as a toxic tailings reservoir.</p><p> The project gained approval through the B.C. government's environmental-assessment process in January 2010 despite widespread opposition from First Nations and environmental groups. On November 2, 2010, the federal cabinet turned down the Prosperity application after a negative review by a Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency panel, which cited 'significant adverse environmental effects'. Of particular concern to the panel were fish and fish habitats, future grizzly-bear populations, and established and potential aboriginal rights and title.</p><p> Taseko has now prepared a new proposal (at an increased estimated cost of 300 million dollars) that is currently under review. The new EIA spares Fish Lake but still impacts Little Fish Lake. According to the company, this has now become economically feasible due to the long-term price projections for gold (if the metals price outlook remains buoyant).</p><p> Despite the new plan, resistance to the plan continues, and the Tsilhqot have called for a day of action on July 22nd to oppose the project.</p><p> Update: in February 2014, the Federal Government rejected the New Prosperity mine stating that the adverse environmental effects of Taseko Mines' New Prosperity project could not be justified, according to a decision by federal cabinet that was announced by Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq. While the current project has been cancelled, they did not close the door entirely, stating that \"The government will continue to make responsible resource development a priority and invites the submission of another proposal that addresses the government's concerns,\" she said. <a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Feds+reject+Taseko+Prosperity+Mine+over+environmental+concerns/9555588/story.html#ixzz31x1q9jxE\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></p>", "conflict_details": "The mine is an open pit mine with a 70,000 tpd concentrator facility with an average annual 108 million pounds of copper production and 247 thousand ounces of gold production over a 20 year mine life.

One is about Kluscap mountains, a sacred area (also known as Kelly Mountain). The second is inÂ Canso, Guysborough County.</p><p>The first protests on Kluscap started decades ago. InÂ the autumn of 1996, Sulian Stone Eagle Herneyâ€”Miâ€™kmaq elder from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, director of the Sacred Mountain Society (SMS), and founder of the First Nations Environmental Networkâ€” was invited to talk to an audience at the Stone Angel CafÃ© in downtown Ottawa. (5) He spoke of the inseparable relationship between First Nations people and nature/land on which claims to sovereignty were based. He had become an environmentalist, he explained, because without land there would be nothing to be a First Nationist about. He traced his growing intervention in environmental politics to the struggle against a corporate proposal to quarry Kluskapâ€™s Mountain, the site of a cave sacred to Kluskap, a figure of central spiritual importance to Miâ€™kmaq people, to produce aggregate for road building in the US. Earlier, Herney had been invited to appear before the public inquiry into a superquarry at Lingerbay, southeast Harris, Scotland,Â Â \"Herneyâ€™s appearance on the Isle of Harris suggests both a common purpose amidst diversity of postcolonial experience at a global level and a certain measure of irony, given the participation of those forced from the land in the Outer Hebrides during the Clearances of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the colonisation of Nova Scotia (Dalby and Mackenzie 1997; Hunter 1994). On Harris, Herney spoke on that occasion of the rekindling of â€œtraditional values and codes of conduct â€¦ that reawakened the true Miâ€™kmaq spirit and spiritual connection to Mother Earth and theCreatorâ€. (5).Â </p><p>The conflict on the Kluscap (or Kelly)Â  mountain continues in 2017 (1). Another granite quarrying conflict takes place near Canso, by the Vulcan MaterialsÂ  Corporation (see Project Details).Â </p><p>These conflicts ate interrelated.Â  In 2017, the Mining Association of Nova Scotia released a report stating that Cape Breton is beingÂ  harmed by the provincial governmentâ€™s Parks and Protected Areas Plan, which limits or prevents mining on development on 154 known mineral occurrences on the island.Â One of those potential projects is an aggregate deposit in Victoria County that is completely covered by the Kluscap Wilderness Area.Â Sean Kirby, executive director of the Mining Association of Nova Scotia, said the Kellys Mountain project has the potential to create 80 direct jobs for 50 years or more.Â â€œItâ€™s very similar in fact to the quarry thatâ€™s at the Strait of Canso...\". , he said. (3)Â Â However, Rod Googoo, chief of Waycobah First Nation, says Kellys Mountain is sacred to the Miâ€™kmaq people, who call it Kluscap Mountain. According to Miâ€™kmaq legend, the prophet Kluscap (or Glooscap) lived in a seaside cave, known locally as the fairy hole, near Cape Dauphin, at the northern tip of the Kluscap Wilderness Area.</p><p>â€œItâ€™s been in our oral tradition for centuries â€” they always talked about that. We donâ€™t have a written a history â€” we have an oral history â€” and weâ€™ve always spoken about Kluscap Mountain as having a very sacred connection to us,â€ said Googoo, who is also the Assembly of Nova Scotia Miâ€™kmaq Chiefsâ€™ lead chief for lands, wildlife and forestry.</p><p>â€œWe, the Miâ€™kmaq people, we would never dare enter into any place which is considered sacred by any other race â€” whether it be a temple, whether it be a church, whether it be a mosque â€” and disrespect it, or deface it, or do something thatâ€™s taboo.â€(3).</p><p>Kirby said while the Mining Association of Nova Scotia agrees with the basic objectives of the protected areas plan, there can be a better balance between the environment and the economy. He suggested a provincially regulated â€œland swapâ€ mechanism that would allow mining companies to trade other ecologically valuable land for land in protected areas that have valuable mineral deposits.(3).</p>", "conflict_details": "(This refers to one of the proposed quarriesin Canso.. The Kluscap (or Kelly) mountains is another famous case, (4).\nA) If the Canso project meets environmental and corporate approvals, construction could begin as early as 2018, bringing with it an anticipated capital investment of $80-million to $100-million (U.S.) and as many as 150 direct and indirect jobs. Over as many as 50 years, developer Vulcan Materials Co. wants to blast and chop up to 400 million tonnes of its granite to ship down the Atlantic coast, where it would be used in roads from Virginia to Florida. (2) \nB) Kluscap (or Kelly Mountain). The Mining Association of Nova Scotia hopes to develop a quarry in the area of Kellys mountain in Cape Breton, but the Miâ€™kmaq say the land is sacred.\nThe picturesque landscape is covered by the Kluscap wilderness and considered First Nation's holy ground, but the association believes thereâ€™s an aggregate deposit of over 2 billion tonnes on the mountain in New Harris, Nova Scotia. .Protesters from First Nations communities gathered near the mountain Saturday, Nov. 25, 2017. \nâ€œThis mountain is sacred to us because it is the departure point of our hero in Kluscap,â€ says protester, Suzanne Patles. â€œIt is the home of the Kluscap caves where we performed ceremonies.â€\nExecutive director for the Mining Association, Sean Kirby says construction of a quarry could potentially employ dozens.\nâ€œIf we were able to make a quarry there it would employ about 80 people directly for a half century so it's a tremendous economic opportunity for the province,â€ says Kirby. â€œ Johnanna Padelt from the Inverness Chapter Council of Canada says itâ€™s not the first time the idea of mining or quarrying on Kellyâ€™s Mountain has been discussed. She was part of a group protesting against a company called Kelly Rock Ltd.,  in the late 1980's.(6).

In June of 2020, the QIA signed the Inuit Certainty Act (ICA) with Baffinland, which outlines the benefits of the mine to the surrounding communities.

Our final product, lumps and fines, are then shipped through our port facility at Milne Inlet, approximately 100 kilometres from the mine site. Due to the quality of the ore, no processing is required before shipping it to market, reducing overall impact to the environment and keeping production costs low. While the mine became operational in 2015 with the first shipments of iron ore to Europe, the Mary River Operation has been an operation over 55 years in the making.\nIn July 1962, Mary Riverâ€™s high-grade iron ore â€“ now known as Deposit No. 1 â€“ was first noted by Murray Watts and Ron Sheardown. The two pilots were conducting an airborne reconnaissance project prospecting across central and northern Baffin Island. In 1986, newly-created Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation acquired the original land claim to develop a mine on the property. Early in the 2000s, we advanced plans to develop the mine. The original plans outlined the development of an 18 million tonne per annum (Mtpa) operation, focused on mining Deposit No. 1. The project also included the development of a railway approximately 150 kilometres south to Steensby Inlet.\nIn 2013, we decided on a phased-approach to development, incorporating community feedback along the way. We continued to refine our operations to accommodate the challenges of northern mining. On January 13, 2013, we proposed changes to the original project to the Nunavut Impact Review Board. On April 29, 2014, the Federal Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada approved the positive recommendation by the Nunavut Impact Review Board. This gave Baffinland the go-ahead for the Early Revenue Phase (ERP) amendment to the Mary River Project involving the seasonal shipping of 3.5 million tonnes of iron ore from Milne Inlet on the north coast of Baffin Island.\"\nSo the actual production is of 3.5 million tons per annum. <a href=\"http://www.baffinland.com/mary-river-mine/mary-river-mine/?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>.  In 2018 the company expect to ship 5 milion tons of ores. Meanwhile the construction of the railway is in dispute.  Transport to harbour is an issue because the trucks carrying the ore destroy the melting ice of the tote road. The permafrost is melting.\nThe whole initial project by Baffinland, as seen in 2008, would have cost 4.1 billion USD. (Globe and Mail, 19 Febr. 2008). \nBy 2019, it is reported that \"the company that owns the Mary River open-pit iron mine on Baffin Island in Nunavut has been sending different messages â€” one to regulators and another to potential investors â€” regarding its expansion plans.  Baffinland currently has approval to ship six million tonnes of iron ore per year from from Milne Inlet, north of the mine. The companyâ€™s public plans for an expansion to its shipping capacity show it loading 12 million tonnes of iron ore into ships, via a 110-kilometre railway, in Milne Inlet every year by 2020 or 2021.

Nothing came of the Yellowknife discovery at the time. The area was considered inaccessible. However, after 1935 and the arrival of commercial aircraft (bush planes) the area became more accessible, and the gold boom began. Â In the summer of 1935, C.J. \"Johnny\" Baker and H. Muir staked the original 21 \"Giant\" claims for Bear Exploration Company. . By 1937, Giant Yellowknife Gold Mines Ltd was created. The company fell on hard times and by 1940, operations came to a standstill. Further, the advent of World War IIÂ  meant a shortage of men to work the site. Soon after the war ended, Giant Mine officially opened, and production moved into full swing. The first gold brick was poured on June 3, 1948.<a href=\"https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100027388/1100100027390\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></p><p>From May to December 1948, the mine produced 8,152 ounces of gold from 49,985 tonnes of ore. Eventually production reached seven million ounces of gold in one of the longest continuous gold mining operations in Canadian mining history; however, they also led to a legacy of contamination (also to bloody episodes of class struggle in 1992 when several workers were killed by a bomb in 1992 meant to frighten scabs and the Royal Oaks company during a lockout).<a href=\"https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/giant-mine-murders\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></p><p>All this took place in a territory originally belonging to the Yellowknives Dene First Nation who are now active in the attempts to clean up the contamination produced by arsenic trioxide waste.Â  Gold at Giant Mine was found in specific minerals called arsenopyrite ore. To release the gold, the ore had to be roasted at extremely high temperatures. Unfortunately, this roasting process also released arsenic rich gas, a highly toxic by-product. In the early days, much of that arsenic was released directly into the environment. This was partially addressed in 1951, with the installation of a Cold Cottrell Electrostatic Precipitator, which acted as a \"scrubber\". It removed a lot of the toxic arsenic trioxide waste, so it did not get released into the environment. Arsenic releases were further reduced, from 7,400 (in 1951) to 2,900 kilograms per day in 1956. This was the result of adding a second \"scrubber\" â€“ a Hot Cottrell Electrostatic Precipitator - to the roasting process in 1955. A further waste reducing innovation was added to the site in 1958. A Dracco baghouse was added to collect the waste. This reduced airborne arsenic emissions to 52 kilograms per day by 1959. Over the years, that number would fluctuate up to 300 kilograms per day. Since the waste was collected instead of released, it needed to be safely stored. In the 1950s, scientists and government agencies agreed storing it in underground chambers was an appropriate, long-term solution. They believed that, when Giant Mine closed permanently, the natural permafrost in the area would re-establish around thestorage vaults and seal in the arsenic trioxide.<a href=\"https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100027388/1100100027390\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>.</p><p>Giant Mine was in full operation for about50 years. During this time, the mine produced 237,000 tonnes of arsenic trioxide waste. K.McPhee argued <a href=\"http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/view/5759\" target=\"_blank\">[11]</a> that trade unions argued that arsenic was killing people. Yellowknife provides an excellent example of working class environmentalism. \"By the 1970s, workers and residents in Yellowknife were increasingly suspicious that the arsenic released as a by-product of gold mining was responsible for the recently perceived rise in local cancer rates. Yet their convictions were dismissed by government officials\"Â  The Yellowknives Dene First Nation became allies in this struggle.</p><p>There are very large environmental liabilities. Giant Mine was owned by different companies over the years. The Giant Yellowknife Mines, Ltd., a subsidiary of Falconbridge, owned the mine from 1948 to 1986. It was next owned by Pamour from 1986 to 1990. In 1990, Royal Oak Resources Ltd. purchased Giant Mine, and formed Royal Oak Mines Inc. In 1997, a technical workshop was held to discuss managing the arsenic trioxide waste stored underground at the mine. This included officials from:Â Â  Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, Â Royal Oak Mines Inc., Â Environment Canada, Â the Government of the Northwest Territories, the City of Yellowknife. By 1999, however, Royal Oak Mines Inc. went into receivership. The courts transferred Giant Mine to the Government of Canada, represented by Indigenous and Northern Affairs. Ore was no longer processed at Giant Mine after 1999. However, in that year, Canada sold the mine's assets to Miramar Giant Mine Ltd., a division of Miramar Mining Corporation. As a condition of the sale, Canada acknowledged Miramar would not be responsible or liable for the existing state of the mine. This meant Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada became a caretaker for the site, including the arsenic trioxide stored underground. Miramar Giant Mine Ltd. ended its obligations under the Reclamation Security Agreement in 2005. At that time, Giant Mine officially became an abandoned mine site.<a href=\"https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100027388/1100100027390\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>.</p><p>However, the areas is contaminated with arsenic still in 2018, and the costs if a clean up in mounting.

The Panel made 107 recommendations, to be met before the project went ahead. Unfortunately, the two most important of these, that a land claims agreement and an impact-benefits agreement be negotiated with the Innu and the Inuit prior to any further development were ignored by both levels of government (Mining Watch, 1999).Â </p><p>The Innu and Inuit have tried many means to halt the companyâ€™s construction plans, including an unsuccessful appeal to Newfoundland Supreme Court.Â </p><p>Timeline of the issue:Â </p><p>1977: The Innu Nation first filed their land claims with the Canadian Government (Arctic Circle, n.d.)Â </p><p>1993: Orr deposit discovered.Â </p><p>November 1994: Diamond Fields Resources (DFR) made a significant mineral find in the area (Innes, 2001).Â </p><p>Fall 1994: Without consultation with the Innu or Inuit, DFR began its exploration work in earnest.

Once at the site, Chief Simeon Tshakapesh and Daniel Ashini delivered an eviction notice to the chief geologist, giving the company twenty-four hours to shut down operations and leave Innu land (Innes, 2001). The Innu â€œdemanded that DFR stop drilling until they had prepared an environmental and cultural protection plan. The threat to economic development was, however, too much of a concern for the Newfoundland government. The Premier of Newfoundland sent in 56 officers of the RCMP (Arctic Circle n.d.). There was a two-week standoff between the Innu and the RCMP (Innes, 2001). An attempt by the Labrador Inuit Association and the Innu Nation to reach a negotiated agreement with the company ended abruptly when they made it clear that the company would not recognize Aboriginal rights and resumed exploration activity (Arctic Circle n.d.). â€œAlthough the Innu action against the company failed to achieve the practical outcome the Innu desired, it was singularly important in many other ways. Publicly, the action established the Innu as one of the principle actors in the drama unfolding around the mineral discovery, but it also helped to unify the Innu response to the project. Innu leaders, spokespeople, elders, and community members consistently articulated positions that centered on the effects of the project on Innu rights, Innu land, and the Innu way of life (Innes, 2001).Â </p><p>Fall 1995: The Innu Nation, under tremendous pressure to respond to this mining activity decided to set up a Task Force on Mining Activities.Â </p><p>1996: Inco Ltd. acquired the rights to the Voiseyâ€™s Bay mine and took over operations.Â </p><p>1997: Innu and Innuit negotiations with Inco broke down after the company â€œrefused to halt construction work on the project.

Cobalt is â€œone of the crucial elements in batteries for cellphones and electric vehiclesâ€ (Jamasmie, 2018). Income from cobalt is a way for Vale to finance construction of the underground mine at Voisey's Bay (Roberts, 2018). Vale has hired the Bank of Montreal to raise around $500 million from bidders for cobalt that will be produced at Voisey's Bay. The deal would be for 3,000 tonnes annually (Roberts, 2018) Vale claims to be â€œplanning to continue working with Innu and Inuit partners for the new expansionsâ€ (Vale, n.d.). â€œJohannes Lampe, president of the Nunatsiavut government, said the announcement marks â€˜a happy day for Labrador Inuit,â€™ with new opportunities for direct employees and contract jobs in transportation and infrastructure around the site.

Like many reservations (which are \"tracts of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band\"), there is no year-round road access to the KI community, making delivery of essential services difficult, and contributing to a low standard of healthcare, education, and community infrastructure.</p><p>In 1929, Treaty 9 was signed, impacting First Nations groups living in Northern Ontario. The treaty promised the First Nations groups in the area an annual income, established education systems, and issued specific lands of reserve to them. The rest of the land was given to the government as territory for European settlers to continue expansion through the province, and the government was permitted to still build on it.&nbsp;</p><p>In May 2000, the KI band council, led by Chief Donny Morris, filed a Treaty Land Entitlement Claim with the Ontario and Canadian Governments. Their claim stated that based on the presence of several culturally and spiritually significant sites, and the traditional use of the area by the KI community, the original lands allotted to the KI reserve should include an additional 19 km2 around the shore of Big Trout Lake and surrounding lands. As the Treaty Land Entitlement claim was being researched, Platinex Inc., a junior mineral exploitation firm was also seeking rights to the KI lands to begin drilling for potential platinum deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 1999, Platinex had obtained mining claims to the Big Trout Lake area, based on the Mining Act which guarantees the law of free entry. In Ontario, miners have the right to use any and all Crown land for staking their claim and prospecting on the land. Their only step is to file a claim with the Ministry and once they have done this, they have the ability to work the land.&nbsp;</p><p>When the KI community was informed of these mining claims, they began a dialogue with Platinex about the traditional use of the land, and by 2001, with support from other First Nations groups in the area, issued a moratorium on development until the use of the land planning was established and the community had been properly consulted. The KI community was not opposed to the development but wanted to be a full partner in the process of this taking place, and be fully consulted.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next few years, while Platinex worked to gather investment funds for the exploration process, they continued to meet with the Chief and the Band Council. They falsely told their investors that they had been given full consent from the KI community to begin â€˜low impact exploration'. By August 2005, the KI community felt that the company had not met the criteria to involve their community, and as a result, they stated that their agreements with Platinex were null and void; they were opposed to any development on their territory. Despite this, by December 2005, Platinex had over $1 million in funds and permission to explore under the Mining Act, they set up camp to begin drilling for platinum in February 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to this, the community members had a peaceful protest at the drilling site and Platinex temporarily withdrew. However, in April, Platinex filed a court injunction against KI from interfering with further exploration to find platinum deposits and filed a $10 billion lawsuit for damages caused by the protests. The KI countersued both Platinex for the damages and then Ontario on the ground that the Mining Act is unconstitutional because it does not recognize Aboriginal and treaty rights.&nbsp;</p><p>When the case was heard in June 2006, the judge ruled in favor of the KI, due to the fact that the KI would suffer â€œirreparable harm due to its loss of culturally and spiritually significant land, and of its connection to the land.â€ An injunction to suspend exploration was granted on the condition that KI would meet with Platinex and representatives from the Ontario Crown to consult and come to an agreement that would allow Platinex to drill nearby, but not necessarily within the TLE claim land.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next six months, a conversation took place between the two parties, but the KI felt that nothing had changed in terms of the sites. However, the court disagreed on the grounds that adequate consultation had taken place and granted Platinex permission to start drilling in specific areas on the KI land by October 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, the KI protested and were brought to court again by Platinex in December 2007. Six members of the KI, including the chief, were charged with contempt of court, being disrespectful to court law, and sentenced to six months in jail.</p><p>However, after two months, the members were released based on the Court of Appealâ€™s ruling that found a disagreement between Ontarioâ€™s Mining Act and section 35 of the constitution which protects indigenous rights and treaty rights for the indigenous people in Canada. A new Mining Act was created that requires consultation and accommodation before certain mining exploration activities can commence. This enables indigenous voices to be properly heard in the process of development taking place on their lands.</p><p>However, following the Court of Appeal decision, in 2009 Platinex attempted to try to access their mining claims one final time. Members of the KI community went out to the lake where the floatplane was supposed to land, circling in boats and canoes to prevent it from landing.&nbsp;</p><p>Platinex then sued the Ontario government for damages, settling for a $5 million payout from the government and 2.5% of future royalties if a mine was ever built there. The conflict was significant to indigenous law in Canada because it brought to light the importance of effective engagement between developers and First Nations communities.</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp; On Jan. 23, 2020 Platinex announced in a news release that it retains the 2.5% but offered to sell all or a part of the royalty to the&nbsp;Ontario government&nbsp;and provide them with information and guidance for mining exploration of the property [see 7].

Over the past two decades, scientists and citizens have been alerting to the fact that populations of fish, invertebrates and other marine animals in the area have been decreasing while the remaining populations have been displaying increasing deformities [1, 2]. These phenomena are due to the high presence of selenium in the waterways of the valley, a substance which is necessary to human health in small doses but becomes toxic in high doses, and which is detrimental and potentially lethal to other non-human animals including fish [1, 2]. The selenium comes from the Elk Valley Mines, which extract metallurgical coal necessary for the manufacturing of steel by applying a â€œcross-valley fillâ€ technique <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/for-decades-b-c-failed-to-address-selenium-pollution-in-the-elk-valley-now-no-one-knows-how-to-stop-it\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>. The rock is first scraped from the surface of the mountainside after which the coal is separated from the rest of the material, which becomes waste <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/for-decades-b-c-failed-to-address-selenium-pollution-in-the-elk-valley-now-no-one-knows-how-to-stop-it\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>. The waste material, which contains the selenium deposits, is left in piles and, through exposure to air and water, slowly seeps selenium into groundwater, eventually reaching river bodies <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/for-decades-b-c-failed-to-address-selenium-pollution-in-the-elk-valley-now-no-one-knows-how-to-stop-it\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>A 2013 report crafted by the biologist Erin Sexton, who has been studying the region since the late 90s, revealed that selenium levels in the water below the coal mines were seven times higher than in water samples above the mines <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/from-canadian-coal-mines-toxic-pollution-that-knows-no-borders\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>. A second report, written and published in 2014 by the federal Ministry of Environment, Environment Canada, warned that selenium pollution in the area was negatively impacting local fish populations and could lead to a population collapse if left untreated <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/for-decades-b-c-failed-to-address-selenium-pollution-in-the-elk-valley-now-no-one-knows-how-to-stop-it\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>. The region is home to the only remaining population â€œgenetically pure west slope cutthroat troutâ€, which has been classified by the federal government as being of â€œspecial concernâ€ [1, 3]. Members of this trout population, which under normal circumstances is understood as being an indicator of ecosystem health, have been displaying spinal and cranial deformities, while in some extreme cases, fish have been found with missing front gill flaps, rendering survival impossible. Additionally, mid-level invertebrates, on which fish feed, have virtually disappeared from the Elk Valley water ecosystem <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/from-canadian-coal-mines-toxic-pollution-that-knows-no-borders\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>. According to experts, the selenium transfers through the food chain by first being converted by bacteria into organic compounds which are then absorbed by algae <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/for-decades-b-c-failed-to-address-selenium-pollution-in-the-elk-valley-now-no-one-knows-how-to-stop-it\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>. The algae is in turn consumed by mid-level invertebrates, which are eaten by fish. Within the fish, the selenium concentrates in the reproductive tissues, namely the eggs and ovaries, producing birth defects and other observable reproductive issues, including declining populations <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/for-decades-b-c-failed-to-address-selenium-pollution-in-the-elk-valley-now-no-one-knows-how-to-stop-it\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mines are located on the traditional territories of the Ktunaxa First Nation and Teck Resources has signed an Impact Management and Benefits Agreement with the First Nation group [2, 4]. The region has been regulated under a provincial policy called the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan which was developed as a partnership between Teck Resources, the provincial government of British Columbia (BC) and the Ktunaxa First Nation <a href=\"https://elkvalleycoal.com/mining-regulations-and-elk-river-selenium-pollution/\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a>. However, the policy has been criticized for focusing on near- and mid-term pollution level issues and not on mitigating the long-term impacts of continued selenium leakage on the ecosystem <a href=\"https://elkvalleycoal.com/mining-regulations-and-elk-river-selenium-pollution/\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a>. Additional federal regulation applied to effluents from coal mining is expected to enter into force, but the scope of this additional regulation has also been critiqued as being insufficient to meaningfully protect the environment <a href=\"https://elkvalleycoal.com/mining-regulations-and-elk-river-selenium-pollution/\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Selenium pollution in the Elk Valley region has also been the cause of cross-border governance and regulation strife between the Canadian province of BC and the neighboring and downstream American state of Montana [1, 2]. The Elk River, which flows from the Rocky Mountains where the mining takes place, eventually feeds into the Koocanusa reservoir and lake on the other side of the border and concern over the levels of selenium in bodies of water has been brewing in Montana [1, 2]. While the BC government has set legislation regulating the levels of allowable selenium seepage, in practice, the legislation has been treated more as guidelines than enforceable and punishable regulation. Indeed, while Teck has repeatedly demonstrated their inability to curtail and diminish levels of selenium seepage and pollution, the BC provincial government has not retracted mining permits, and, on the contrary has even issued new permits to the company <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/from-canadian-coal-mines-toxic-pollution-that-knows-no-borders\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>. American officials have even accused their Canadian counterparts of ignoring and suppressing key data pointing to the extent of the environmental impacts of mining in the region <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/canada-suppressing-data-on-coal-mine-pollution-say-u-s-officials/\" target=\"_blank\">[6]</a>.

Three propositions for entirely new mines have come from other companies, while Teck has proposed an expansion of one of its existing mines, the Fording River mine, onto the neighboring Castle Mountain <a href=\"https://wildsight.ca/blog/2020/05/11/bighorn-sheep-and-their-threatened-habitat/\" target=\"_blank\">[7]</a>.

Its spokesperson has belittled the concerns of the population by comparing their requests to â€œnoiseâ€ on numerous occasions <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1129223/sayona-quebec-conference-institut-canadien-mines-valdor\" target=\"_blank\">[17]</a>. Moreover, the company broke several of its public commitments, including that of holding public feedback meetings in September 2018 on comments and concerns raised by its activities. In October 2018, Sayona Mining went so far as to make a misleading speech in a public presentation, claiming that its project was the smallest in Quebec.</p><p>On December 20, 2018, Sayona Mining submitted its official request for a certificate of authorization to the Ministry of the Environment and the Fight against Climate Change. This triggered the three-month period granted to the Minister of the Environment to submit the Authier project to the BAPE.</p> <p>Without delay, the Esker Citizen Protection Committee sent a request for access to information to the Minister of the Environment to obtain all the documents concerning the Authier project. It was only by analyzing confidential technical documents that the Citizen Committee ended up discovering that in reality, the project should already be considered as automatically subject to the BAPE since the daily ore extraction capacity exceeded the threshold of 2000 tonnes per day.</p> <p>Based on this observation, the Citizen's Committee quickly sent a formal notice to the Minister of the Environment urging him to submit the project to the BAPE <a href=\"https://www.lecitoyenvaldoramos.com/article/2019/02/27/projet-authier-le-ministre-de-l-environnement-mis-en-demeure\" target=\"_blank\">[18]</a>.</p> <p>The Authier project was finally submitted to the BAPE in early March 2019, thanks to citizen mobilization and the threat of legal action against the Minister of the Environment.</p> <p>More than two years later, the impact assessment for the project is still not complete, but the public expects the project to be submitted to the BAPE soon.</p> <p>The company now seeks to present its project as â€œgreenâ€ on two counts. First, they claim to operate on a supply of renewable hydroelectric power, minimizing their carbon footprint at the point of production. Second, the spodumene produced will contribute to batteries for electric vehicles, thus positioning their company as part of the needed energy transition. Alexis Segal, vice-president of corporate affairs at Sayona Quebec made the following statement to that effect: \"Lithium is part of the solution to global warming. As you know, the growth in demand for lithium is around 35% per year and we currently have the opportunity to enter this market with a production of lithium ore which is more green than elsewhere in the world, because it will be made from hydroelectric energy â€ <a href=\"https://www.iheartradio.ca/energie/energie-rouyn/nouvelles/les-permis-du-projet-authier-a-l-automne-2019-1.8569651\" target=\"_blank\">[19]</a>.

Its physical properties of thermal and electrical conductivity make it one of the most coveted minerals in the context of the energy transition, in particular for its use in the manufacturing of electric batteries. According to an estimate by the World Bank, graphite will account for 53.8% of the demand for minerals required in the manufacturing of batteries worldwide until 2050 <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/extractiveindustries/brief/climate-smart-mining-minerals-for-climate-action#:~:text=A%20new%20World%20Bank%20Group,demand%20for%20clean%20energy%20technologies.\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a>.

More than half of the current production of graphite is located in China (60%) followed by Mozambique (11%) and Brazil (8.6%). Its geostrategic importance is currently pushing European and North American governments (United States and Canada) to develop their own mining projects as a way to reduce their dependence on China in the supply of these minerals deemed as \"critical\".</p> Quebec's mining law is outdated and needs to be reformed. On October 20th, 2020, several organizations and elected officials denounced the lack of environmental protection measures in the new government plan on critical minerals announced the same day <a href=\"https://miningwatch.ca/fr/news/2020/10/29/l-environnement-des-mines-aux-batteries-qu-bec-besoin-d-un-lectrochoc?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_25696d05fd21ebc6676af23d3531aa058006e44d-1627374330-0-gqNtZGzNAjijcnBszQki\" target=\"_blank\">[26]</a>.<a>&nbsp;</a> <p>Since the projectâ€™s announcement, the local population and various environmental organizations have shown their opposition to it in light of the multiple socio-environmental impacts it could generate.</p><p>To produce 100,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate per year, the mine will have to extract almost 2.3 million tonnes of materials annually as the graphite content of the deposit is estimated at just over 4%. The company claims to treat its mining waste on site using a co-disposal method (which separates acid-generating minerals such as pyrite and pyrrhotite from the rest of the materials) <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/extractiveindustries/brief/climate-smart-mining-minerals-for-climate-action#:~:text=A%20new%20World%20Bank%20Group,demand%20for%20clean%20energy%20technologies.\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a> <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-graphite.pd\" target=\"_blank\">[6]</a>. This solution, the benefits of which are not yet proven, is criticized because of its experimental nature and the possible contamination of groundwater that it could cause (e.g., acidification of groundwater and surface water as well as possible contamination from heavy metals). Indeed, the acid-generating residues indefinitely retain their polluting potential, which generates a risk of contamination over several centuries in the event of an accident, erosion or non-maintenance of the deposit site even after mining has ended.</p><p>In addition to posing a risk to several lakes surrounding the mining site, this possible contamination of surface and groundwater could greatly affect Lac Taureau, a regional natural park and a tourism site located less than 10 km downstream from the mining project. Indeed, Lac Taureau is one of the most important resort sites near Montreal. This risk generated the mobilization of the Association for the Protection of Lake Taureau, which published numerous bulletins to inform the local population about the impacts of the project <a href=\"http://www.aplt.org/Bulletin%2030.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[8]</a> <a href=\"http://www.aplt.org/Bulletin%2031.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[9]</a> <a href=\"http://www.aplt.org/Bulletin%2032.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[10]</a> and the contradictions put forth by the actors promoting it <a href=\" http://www.aplt.org/Communique2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[11]</a>.</p><p>Created in 2016 and mobilizing several citizens of the municipality, the Coalition of Opponents to a Mining Project in Haute-Matawinie (COPH) (www.lacoph.com), has been raising awareness among citizens (e.g. through public meetings with independent experts), following municipal officials and publicly denouncing the multiple environmental impacts associated with this project <a href=\"https://nouveaumonde.group/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BFS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a>. They have also been demonstrating the potential socio-economic consequences of the project, which could affect the health of the local population and undermine the region's recreational and tourist vocation <a href=\"http://www.lacoph.com/worries\" target=\"_blank\">[12]</a>.</p><p>The other serious issue around this project is the fact that the mine site is located in Nitaskinan, the ancestral territory of the Atikamekw First Nation <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/espaces-autochtones/1770944/manawan-decret-nouveau-monde-graphite-mine-saint-michel-des-saints\" target=\"_blank\">[13]</a> <a href=\"https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/idees/596266/avec-la-mine-au-nitaskinan-la-reconciliation-peut-attendre\" target=\"_blank\">[14]</a>. The Atikamekw people have long been affected by natural resource development projects on their territory, conducted by private actors in the forestry, hydroelectric, hunting and fishing industries <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/espaces-autochtones/1520550/atikamekw-exploitation-territoire-constant-awashish-ancestra\" target=\"_blank\">[15]</a>.

Faced with these problems and the deadlock in negotiations with the Canadian government, in 2014, the Atikamekw Nation unilaterally declared its sovereignty over Nitaskinan, reaffirming its ancestral rights over this territory and requiring its consent for all development and use of resources <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/683598/nation-atikamekw-declaration-souverainete-territoire\" target=\"_blank\">[17]</a>. To this end, the Atikamekw Council of Manawan strongly denounced the government granting a decree to NMG while there is still a lack of social acceptability within the community. The decree is considered to represent a step backwards in reconciliation <a href=\"https://miningwatch.ca/fr/news/2021/2/12/projet-de-nouveau-monde-graphite-la-nation-de-manawan-d-nonce-lautorisation-de-qu-bec\" target=\"_blank\">[19]</a>.</p><p>The company, which prides itself on having a social acceptability of 82% for the mining project <a href=\"https://nouveaumonde.group/fr/developpement-durable/\" target=\"_blank\">[18]</a>, misleadingly claims that the project simply divides the community. In this regard, the report of the Bureau of Public Hearings on the Environment (BAPE) underlined that â€œin the sampling methodology used in the two surveys commissioned by NMG, the latter had underestimated the population of vacationers who, within the meaning of the impact study of the Matawinie mining project, constitutes an important stakeholder. The sample included 5% of vacationers, whereas they constitute approximately 50% of the population residing in the territory of the municipality of SMDS \"<a href=\"http://www.lacoph.com/public/doc/Rapport%20353%20-%20Enqu%C3%AAte%20et%20audience%20publique.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[20]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In its report made public in June 2020, the Quebec BAPE concluded that the Nouveau Monde mining project still raised \"important issues of social acceptability\" and recommended no less than half a dozen additional studies \"before the project can be authorized â€. These additional studies relate to, for example, â€œan update of the hydrogeological study confirming, on the basis of convincing results from experimental cells validating the various geochemical characterizations, that the mining waste management method, known as co- disposal, is effective and would not indefinitely adversely affect the quality of groundwater. â€œ (BAPE report - Page 101, own translation) <a href=\"http://www.lacoph.com/public/doc/Rapport%20353%20-%20Enqu%C3%AAte%20et%20audience%20publique.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[20]</a> <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1715528/mine-ciel-ouvert-saint-michel-des-saints-nouveau-monde-graphite-bape\" target=\"_blank\">[21]</a>.</p><p>However, in February 2021 the government of Quebec issued a decree authorizing the NMG project without requiring the company to provide the additional studies suggested by the BAPE. This decision has enhanced the anger and concern of mobilized organizations and shows the contradictory discourse and existing inconsistencies between the various government institutions. As May Dagher of the COPH stated: \"This decision is all the more dismaying as the Minister of the Economy, Mr. Fitzigibbon, had promised us that Quebec would follow all the recommendations of the BAPE before authorizing such a projectâ€ <a href=\"https://www.laction.com/article/2021/02/10/projet-minier-en-haute-matawinie-une-coalition-denonce-la-decision-de-quebec\" target=\"_blank\">[23]</a>. In response to this decision, a road was temporarily blockaded by Matawinie Ekoni Aci Mobilization <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/espaces-autochtones/1774490/militants-autochtones-blocus-opposition-projet-minier-atikamekw-manawan\" target=\"_blank\">[24]</a>.</p><p>In conclusion, the project in its current form is not green, sustainable, nor carbon neutral. On the one hand, NMG advocates the green dream discourse (clean energy, responsible minerals) and is developing an extensive media campaign aimed at convincing public opinion that they have the solution to the problem of the shortage of critical materials necessary for the energy transition \"We have graphite, tons of graphite, millions of tons of graphite\" and to promote their business through greenwashing slogans \"we are green, we are keen and we are ready\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYSE_NMG/status/1370134811554234373?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">[27]</a>. And on the other hand, the observation of a much less glowing reality: mining waste, social impacts, greenwashing. The COPH for example made a video to counter the false campaign of NMG by addressing the concept of â€œsustainable destructionâ€ linked to this mining project [28].</p><p>The electrification of transport is necessary for the energy transition, but it cannot come at any price!

The areas newly acquired by Canada Carbon covered â€‹â€‹4,152 hectares, which is to say nearly a third of the municipality of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge. Phase 1 of this new project would consist in the extraction of marble and graphite from three open pits and the construction of an on-site flotation plant, which would occupy a total area of â€‹â€‹62 ha. The construction of a heat treatment plant in Asbury, 150 km northwest of the Miller site, is also being planned. Annual production is expected to amount to 1,515 tons of seam graphite (very high purity, nuclear quality) and 150,000 tons of marble <a href=\"https://www.canadacarbon.com/docs/Canada_Carbon_Presentation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://www.canadacarbon.com/docs/Miller-PEA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a> <a href=\"https://projetmiller.ca/projet-miller\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a>.</p><p>Graphite is a mineral considered of critical importance in the current context of energy transition because it is key to manufacturing Li-Ion batteries that power electric vehicles. However, due to the high purity of the deposits at the Miller site, this resource is not in fact targeting battery production, but rather production of small modular reactors (SMRs) that can generate electricity for remote areas without greenhouse gases. This type of power generation would replace the diesel power plants commonly used today. The key problem is that the development of such reactors is highly hypothetical, entails high speculation in the valuation of this type of graphite and, significantly, is still at the research stage.</p><p>The company, with its redesigned project, is simultaneously proposing a plan to develop and restore a maple grove that it has itself partially destroyed and to return the residues to the pit once the graphite mining has been completed. However, this process has never been carried out in the area. Moreover, electrifying the projectâ€™s machinery will certainly require a more powerful electrical connection than that currently available near the future site (let alone the development of this electrification). Another problematic aspect of the project relates to its water requirements and specifically the quantities of discharge that will be accumulated in a retention basin so close to the wetland to the south of the project. Will the hydrological basin be able to withstand such a drain without consequence on the rivers which cross or are near to the future site?</p><p>In December 2016, Canada Carbon presented a seemingly fabulous project to the municipal council of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge (GSLR). Excited by the presentation, the council forwent any form of consultation and provided its approval for the project to the Commission de Protection du Territoire Agricole du QuÃ©bec (CPTAQ).

Indeed, the profits from mining would go first to the shareholders - often foreign - while the short and long term problems would burden the local population <a href=\"https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/4fcf6bf4-7a55-4185-80f9-309603e73bb9/downloads/1cabi7hm3_43252.pdf?ver=1560616024442\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a>.</p><p>- Lack of social acceptability of the project, lack of detailed and preventive information on these possible impacts.

The company will use a rolling resource approach to manage the graphite deposit. It will continue to explore within its claims during the delineation and production phases of the resource. Depending on the quantities found it could submit a request to expand the project to open other pits within the territory. This is a calculated approach on the part of the company, which allows it to initially apply for a smaller project to start operations faster. Indeed, a request made for a larger project would initially require more time, could require an evaluation by the Bureau of Public Hearings on the Environment (BAPE) and would raise more questions. In the same logic of avoiding a BAPE study, the project claims to produce 499 tonnes daily in order to be just below the production threshold that requires a BAPE study (500 tonnes) <a href=\"https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/4fcf6bf4-7a55-4185-80f9-309603e73bb9/downloads/2017-10-28%20%20R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf?ver=1560616024386\" target=\"_blank\">[6]</a> <a href=\"https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/4fcf6bf4-7a55-4185-80f9-309603e73bb9/downloads/1caoh429e_805449.pdf?ver=1560616024690\" target=\"_blank\">[7]</a>.

In February 2018, the new municipal council canceled the favorable opinion issued by the former municipal council to the CPTAQ for the use of agricultural land. In addition, based on an amendment to the Mining Act, which grants regional county municipalities (RCMs) \"the power to delimit, in their land use planning and development plan, territories incompatible with mining&nbsp; activities,â€ the municipality amended its zoning by-law to prohibit mining activities <a href=\"https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2018/11/09/compagnie-miniere-la-poursuite-de-96-m-contre-une-ville-pourrait-etre-suspendue\" target=\"_blank\">[9]</a> <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1017380/projet-mine-grenville-sur-la-rouge-municipalite-compteurs-zero\" target=\"_blank\">[10]</a>.</p><p>The following month, in March 2018, Canada Carbon responded by filing a C $ 96 million lawsuit against the municipality of GSLR. This suit, prepared by the firm Beauregard Avocats, represents one of the largest lawsuits targeting a municipality in the history of Quebec. It is equivalent to 17 times the budget of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge or more than $ 32,000 per citizen <a href=\"https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2018/11/09/compagnie-miniere-la-poursuite-de-96-m-contre-une-ville-pourrait-etre-suspendue\" target=\"_blank\">[9]</a>. This claim for damages was denounced as abusive by the municipality, SOS GSLR and other organizations. It is seen as a form of intimidation of city council members and a way of limiting their freedom of expression <a href=\"https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/justice-et-faits-divers/actualites-judiciaires/201811/09/01-5203566-poursuite-de-96-millions-dune-miniere-grenville-sur-la-rouge-entendue-aujourdhui.php\" target=\"_blank\">[11]</a>. In the same logic of intimidation, a complaint was filed by the company against one of the members of SOS GSLR.</p><p>This request for 96 million also shows the true face of Canada Carbon, which officially presents itself as \"a small mining company proposing a very small mining project with the most benign environmental impact possible,\" yet which does not hesitate to threaten to bankrupt the community whose approval it is still seeking <a href=\"https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/idees/543568/l-art-d-avoir-toujours-raison-de-canada-carbon\" target=\"_blank\">[12]</a>. It also shows its lack of respect for citizen decision-making, as Ugo Lapointe of Mining Watch Canada noted: â€œThis company fails the social acceptability test and throws oil on the fire. The new city council was elected with a strong majority. If in 2018, the municipalities can no longer decide which development is best for their population, we have a problem â€<a href=\"https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2018/11/09/compagnie-miniere-la-poursuite-de-96-m-contre-une-ville-pourrait-etre-suspendue\" target=\"_blank\">[9]</a>.</p><p>In addition, a report published on the technical and economic viability of the Miller project of the mining company Canada Carbon shows that the project \"is not worth $ 96 million as the company is currently claiming.\" Such damages cannot be claimed when the project remains highly speculative and the economic viability of the project has not been demonstrated <a href=\"https://miningwatch.ca/sites/default/files/2019-05-grenville-sur-la-rouge-canadacarbon-rappportexpert_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[13]</a>.</p><p>As the legal battle continues, another strategy is also being used by the residents of Grenville and members of SOS GLSR. Article 235 of the new version of the Quebec Mining Act requires \"written authorization\" from the owners before a company can access their land and carry out mining exploration work. Thus landowners of lands on which Canada Carbon has claims are being invited to send a letter to the company indicating their refusal for the company to access to their property <a href=\"https://sosgslr.ca/la-lettre\" target=\"_blank\">[14]</a>. About 80 owners will send letters prohibiting access to more than 100 lots and lots in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge; â€œThese properties cover more than 600 hectares and represent more than 80% of the owners most directly affected by the Canada Carbon Miller project. This is once again a strong message that there is no social acceptability for this project,\" says Normand Ã‰thier, co-spokesperson for the SOS GSLR group <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1179715/grenville-sur-la-rouge-canada-carbon-mine-interdiction-acces-terrain\" target=\"_blank\">[15]</a>.</p><p>In February 2020, the company dropped the lawsuits against the municipality following an out-of-court settlement. The agreement between the two parties stipulates that Canada Carbon must submit its project to the Office of Public Hearings on the Environment of Quebec (BAPE), hold public consultations on all aspects of the project, limit blasting and crushing activities, comply with noise and dust limits established by regulation and share the costs of modifying GSLR's municipal roads <a href=\"https://www.editionap.ca/tribune-express/dossier-canada-carbon--profond-soupir-de-soulagement-6a929ee3bc8e0757ff2a48418ffa5e8d?sourceOrganizationKey=eap\" target=\"_blank\">[16]</a> <a href=\"https://projetmiller.ca/entente-avec-gslr\" target=\"_blank\">[17]</a>.</p><p>In July 2021, after hearing the reluctance of several experts, citizens, the Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA), the MRC d'Argenteuil and the municipality, the CPTAQ changed its originally favorable preliminary opinion to Canada Carbon that it issued the previous summer. It also refused permission for the operation of a quarry and a mine on the territory of Grenville-sur-laRouge: â€œThe commission considers that at the time it gave its decision, it did not have all the information required to assess the project in its real state.

After a long legal process, the multinational company Sayona Mining Limited (Sayona Mining) was awarded the mining rights in August 2021 <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1820436/mine-north-lithium-sayona-quebec-abitibi-vente\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>.</p> <p>This mining project was originally called Quebec Lithium yet its name was changed in June 2016 by the Chinese company Jien International Investment after a first bankruptcy. The difficulties of the promoters of the project are mainly due to the lack of financing, the difficulty in extracting the ore and a fall in the price of spodumene on the international markets. The last owners had accumulated debts of more than 200 million Canadian dollars and had failed in their obligation to deposit as collateral the 23 million dollars intended for the restoration of the mine site once the operations ended <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1172710/mine-lithium-la-corne-dette-syndic-faillite-ressources-naturelles\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>.</p> <p>The NAL mine has a heavy environmental liability and is known to have escaped rigorous environmental assessments. When the project was presented in 2010, the proponents managed to avoid the Environmental Impact Assessment and Review Procedure (PEEIE) by presenting a daily ore extraction capacity just below the threshold required by the Office of Public Hearings on the Environment (BAPE) of the province of Quebec. The project also began operation before all the environmental assessments were completed <a href=\"https://sesat.ca/RadDocuments/Rapport%20SESAT%20-%20RÃ‰A%20North%20American%20Lithium%20-%20volet%20eau%20souterraine.pdf>\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a>.</p> <p>In its early days, the project seemed to have passed under the radar of civil society, which only mobilized a little, although some environmental groups and independent scientific organizations had submitted critical reports, such as Action borÃ©ale and SociÃ©tÃ© de l'Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue groundwater (SESAT).</p> <p>The Quebec government has injected - and lost - several million dollars, notably through Investissement QuÃ©bec (IQ).&nbsp;</p> <p>Initially, the goal was to produce spodumene for export to China. In 2019, a lithium carbonate production complex was built, but production was short-lived <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1172710/mine-lithium-la-corne-dette-syndic-faillite-ressources-naturelles\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>. Its acquisition in 2021 by Sayona Mining Limited and its partner Piedmont Lithium has sent a warning signal as new environmental issues are likely to appear with the development strategy of the new buyers. This strategy consists in centralizing the processing on the NAL site of ores possibly coming from the Authier Lithium mining projects in Abitibi and that of Tansim in TÃ©miscamingue, which to this day remain at the stage of mining exploration projects. However, such an increase in the volume of ore from two other mine sites would cause a considerable accumulation of mine waste at the NAL site. This would inevitably lead to major impacts on the environment, in particular on the fragile balance of the water system including groundwater.</p> <p>Under warning of incurring penalties, the new buyers have made a commitment to the Quebec government to transform spodumene into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide by building a new plant within 6 to 10 years <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1820436/mine-north-lithium-sayona-quebec-abitibi-vente\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>.</p> <p>Moreover, the size of the surface mine has increased significantly over the years since the initial feasibility study. In 2011, the dimensions of the pit were 500mX300mX150m whereas in 2013 they rose to 1100mX570mX190m. The total tonnage also increased by 45.2% between 2010 and 2018. The environmental impacts of this considerable increase in the size of the project have not to date been the subject of a follow-up hydrogeological study.</p> <p>The NAL mine is infamous for its numerous releases of toxic contaminants into the environment.&nbsp; An â€˜access to informationâ€™ request revealed a compilation of 83 emergency reports at the NAL mine from March 13, 2013 to September 9, 2018. These reports documented several spills totaling more than 50 millions of liters of mine tailings, antifreeze, diesel, oil, process water, etc. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MpTyocfeYev1H3_U4VTLbbl257Rnr4y1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117936377786709068603&rtpof=true&sd=true\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a>. Of these incidents, two environmental accidents are of particular concern:</p> <p>-On March 18, 2013, an accidental spill of 50 million liters of water and quartz occurred following a dam fracture at a tailings facility.

In the days that follow, the solid part was recovered in the belt ditch and the liquid part was largely pumped into the tailings pond <a href=\"https://sesat.ca/RadDocuments/Rapport%20SESAT%20-%20RÃ‰A%20North%20American%20Lithium%20-%20volet%20eau%20souterraine.pdf>\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a>.</p> <p>In both cases, as for the other 81 cases listed between March 13, 2013 and September 9, 2018, no comprehensive environmental study was subsequently carried out to monitor the quality of the groundwater. Indeed, hydrogeological studies of the NAL mine have simply never been completed since its launch in 2011 <a href=\"https://sesat.ca/RadDocuments/Rapport%20SESAT%20-%20RÃ‰A%20North%20American%20Lithium%20-%20volet%20eau%20souterraine.pdf>\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a>, while significant consequences on groundwater and hydrous environments are feared by several groups <a href=\"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1482273/mine-north-american-lithium-impacts-sesata\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a>.</p> <p>The Regroupement vigilance mines Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue monitors developments surrounding operations at the NAL mine.

Graphite is a type of mineral extracted that is used to create electrical products like batteries. The project plans to extract a significant amount of graphite as a contribution to the growing demand (within the 'green economy') for alternatives to fossil fuels. In fact, in 2020 the Government of Quebec released a \"Plan for the Development of Critical and Strategic Minerals,\" which highlighted the province's intention to become a key provider of the materials such as graphite that will be in demand in the coming decades due to the planned increase in production of electric vehicles (EVs) </span><a href=\"https://lomiko.com/projects/\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a><a href=\"https://www.quebec.ca/en/government/policies-orientations/quebec-plan-development-critical-strategic-minerals\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">.

Although there may be positive outcomes of the project for the region's economy, there are also severe socio-ecological impacts that may emerge from the development of the project, including effects on land loss, pollution of nearby water sources, habitat loss for wildlife, and a reduced quality of life in the nearby municipalities. As a result, residents and environmental groups have taken action and protested against the further advancement of the project.

These municipalities argued that they have far too little a voice in influencing decisions that happen in their territories related to the mining industry in general, and that their concerns (re. potential impacts on the environment, tourism, etc.) have gone unheeded. The five municipalities included in their report 10 proposals for a fairer, more equitable and sustainable mining framework. They made practical suggestions for the processes led by the ministry of resources to become more democratic. Suggestions included, for example: for the consultation process to be mandatory early on, and to include questions of social acceptability from the beginning; for an improvement in terms of compensation frameworks and community agreements related to mining projects happening in Quebec; and for the ministry responsible for the environment (MELCCFP) to be more involved in the approval process in order to add clarity regarding risk to water, biodiversity, etc. and to speak to the restoration plans laid out by a given mining company </span><a href=\"https://www.coalitionqlaim.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Memoire-des-municipalites-V2-01-05-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[6]</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Lomiko acknowledges on its website that the mine is situated on the territory of the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg (KZA) First Nation, which is part of the Algonquin Nation, however there is not noticeable mobilizing by this Indigenous community against the project. <br></span></p>", "conflict_details": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8.5pt;
